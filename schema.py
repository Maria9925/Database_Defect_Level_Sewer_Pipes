"""
Database schema for Defect-Level Sewer Pipe Condition Modeling
==============================================================

Code Structure
--------------
The code is organized into three main sections:

Section 1: Factors
    Contains physical, environmental, climatic, operational, and geospatial
    factors that influence sewer deterioration.

Section 2: Defects
    Stores inspection events (e.g., CCTV) and defect-level observations
    extracted from these inspections.

Section 3: Failures
    Records failure events affecting the sewer system, including their causes,
    impacts, and connection to pipe interventions.
"""

"""
Section 1: Factors
==================

This section defines the factor-related entities of the ERD.
These entities describe the physical, environmental, and operational context
of each sewer pipe. The following entities are included:
